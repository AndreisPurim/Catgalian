Basically, a Risc-V inspired Old Prussian assembly language.

Other than being a very basic assembly I have not thought on any specific thing,
except the idea that the assembler should tell the tale of the code as an heroic saga, such as

"In the beginning, the warrior loaded his sword (R1) into his bag (memory)..."

And that the errors should be ominous, like:

"CURSE: "Your program lacks harmony; the gods demand balance at line 24."
