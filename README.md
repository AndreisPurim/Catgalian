# 🐱🇱🇻 *Catgalian*: Programming C in Latgalian

*Catgalian* (C plus Latgalian) is an esolang/joke programming language inspired by the Latgalian dialect¹ based on Mini-C. It is not suppose to be taken seriously, so have fun.

**Disclaimer 1:** I don't speak Latgalian at all, so feel free to make corrections.
**Disclaimer 2:** For now, the best I have is a silly "compiler" that transforms the *catgalian* input into javascript and runs *eval()* to see the output in the website. It took around 30 minutes to make so it is not supposed to be serious. But I do plan on actually explaining catgalian into a fully functional language in some nearby future!

Feel free to contribute and help this silly project grow!
