Idea: make a truly esoteric programming language based on Dainas.

People should programm writing poems, such as

"A young lad walks through the field,  # Initialize a loop
In his hand five stones he holds.    # Define range (1-5)
He counts them one by one,           # Summing up
Until the bag is full.               # Output result"

And the program should be able to interpret it (the best it can) and output a code.
